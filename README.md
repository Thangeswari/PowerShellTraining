Write-Host "The best and easiest technology to learn-POwerShell"

As a Microsoft Trainer, the best so far is the PowerShell. This is easy to learn and also solve many requirements with ease in a very short span of time.

This contains many many scripts, videos, tutorials. The reference used is from the Jump Start Tutorial of MVA by none other than PowerShell
creator Jeff Snover. 

Happy Scripting!!!
